# Floor-Based Mastery System — The Palace Ascent

## Philosophy Shift: Floors > Rooms

The Palace is meant to be climbed **floor by floor**, not room-by-random-room. Each floor represents a complete conceptual level that builds on the previous. This ensures genuine pedagogical progression instead of cherry-picking easy wins.

- **Floors 2-8** are locked until the previous floor is completed
- **Completion Criteria:**

  2. Pass floor comprehensive assessment
  3. Meet streak requirements

**Example Progression:**
1. User completes 3 rooms on Floor 1 → Floor 1 assessment unlocked

3. User completes 3 rooms on Floor 2 → Floor 2 assessment unlocked
